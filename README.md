Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

The factorial(n) function checks if the number is 0 or 1 and returns 1.
Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with n-1 and multiplies the result.
The function is called with the number 5 and prints the result.

Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

Square root using math.sqrt()
Natural logarithm using math.log()
Sine of the number (in radians) using math.sin()
